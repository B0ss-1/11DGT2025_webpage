                <p>The story is split into 25 scenarios, or sections of the game, each taking about 30 minutes per player. All the scenarios have a map made of hexagons and will have some monsters on it.  Each round the players choose two cards to play from their hand, choosing the initiative value (the number in the centre) of one of them. After all players have chosen, all players reveal their cards at the same time and draw the top card of the monster’s ability deck. Players and monsters then go in initiative order, from low to high. Each player then chooses one action on the top of one card, and the action on the bottom of the other card. The two main things players will be doing are moving and attacking. Moving allows you to get closer or further away from enemies, while attacking allows you to damage enemies. Whenever someone attacks, that player draws an attack modifier card from their deck, changing the amount of damage the monster takes. After a player finishes their turn, both cards go to their discard pile. Monsters will also take a turn, focusing on the closest player and trying to attack, following a procedure that all monsters follow. Once a player runs out of cards, they must do what is called a rest. A player can choose between a short rest or a long rest, each giving you all but one card from their discard pile back into their hand. The card that didn’t go into your hand goes into the lost pile. A long rest allows a player to choose which card they want to lose, heal two hit points, and recover certain items but takes a whole turn. A short rest enables players to not take a full turn to rest, at the cost of not healing, not recovering items, and having their lost card to be randomly chosen. Players become exhausted after they have no cards to play, or they have zero hit points. The players win if they have completed the objective, and the players lose if all players are exhausted.</p>
