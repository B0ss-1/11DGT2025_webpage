                    Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is a cooprative campain board game that acts as a smaller prequel to the massive board game Gloomhaven. The game aims to make the experience of playing easier to for new players to start, while also having new content for veterans to enjoy with the full game. The game is split into 25 scenarios each taking about 30 minutes per player. Each round the players choose two cards to play, choosing the initiative value of one of them. After all players have choosen, all players reveal their cards and draw the top card of the monsters abiltity deck. Players and monsters then go in initiative order, from low to high. All cards are then dicarded and a new round begins. Characters move around the board, attacking monsters and looting treasure until the goal of the scenario is completed.<br><br>
                    The backwater town of Gloomhaven is set in a fantasy world where danger lurks in many places. Gloomhaven is a place where all the peoples of this realm can live, and the militaristic government can keep the city safe. Or at least from outside of the city. Mercenaries operate within and around the city to protect the people from threats outside or inside the city that the military can’t do, refuse to do, or are unaware of, so long as they are getting paid. The story of the game follows the<em> “Jaws of the Lion”</em>, one of the most well-known mercenary groups in the lands.<br><br>
                    The Jaws of the Lion consists of four different characters, the Hatchet, the Red Guard, the Demolitionist, and the Voidwarden.  The Inox Hatchet is a hulking figure who throw axes at enemies. The Valrath Red Guard is armoured in an iconic red armour and wields a sickle attached to a chain after being outcast by his own culture. The Quatryl Demolitionist uses explosives and piston fists in combat. And the Human Voidwaren can manipulate minds and give boons to allies. All seeking fame and fortune, yet also want to serve the small town, the Jaws of the Lion go on a quest to find a missing blacksmith.<br><br>
